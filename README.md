This project is about directed weighted graphs and algorithms.
The main task of this project is to run algorithms on a graph and visual it with GUI.
We built a menu that the user can run a bunch of cool algorithms on the graph and can see it on the screen.
The user can also do other stuff like add node or removing one and more.

##The classes in this project:
### MyNode:
Representing a node in the graph.
### MyEdge:
Representing a edge bewteen two nodes in the graph.
### MyGeo:
Representing a point3d of the node.
### DWGraph:
Representing a graph with those methods:
#### Get Node.
#### Get Edge.
#### Add Node.
#### Connect.
#### Node Iterator.
#### Edge Iterator.
#### Remove Node.
#### Remove Edge.
### DWGraphAlgorithms:
Representing all the algorithms that will run on the graph with those methods:
#### Is connected.
#### Shortest path distance.
#### Shortest path nodes.
#### Center.
#### TSP.
#### Save to JSON.
#### Load from JSON.
### GraphWindow:
#### Representing the Gui.
